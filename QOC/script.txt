But what makes it unique?

My Institute

In addition to this, colgrow offers you a special space to interact specifically with students of your university, ask questions, post publicly and much more.

Go Anonymous - For You

And then comes the best part of the app! You can go anonymous and browse throughout the app without any restrictions or compromising with your security.

Communities (Anonymous) 

Join public communities anonymously

My Institute (Anonymous)

or browse through your institute's anonymous feed

Ask / Post (Anonymous)

Ask or post anonymously

Chat (Anonymous)

or chat with the people of your interest.

In 'go anonymous' mode, no-one knows each other's identities, and combined with profanity filtering APIs and instant anonymous id blocking system, there is no scope of targeting or cyber bullying.

With control in your hands now... happy connecting with colgrow.
